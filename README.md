A comprehensive tool for navigating metro in the city of Hyderabad , Telangana.


The "Hyderabad Metro Rail App" is a Java program designed to provide information about the Hyderabad Metro system. It takes user input for the source and destination stations and calculates the fare and shortest metro route between them. The program utilizes data structures such as Graphs and Heaps to represent metro stations, connections, distances, and fares.

Key Features
User Input: Accepts source and destination station names from the user.
Graph Representation: Stations are represented as nodes in a graph, with edges representing connections between stations along with distance and cost information.
Shortest Path Algorithms: Utilizes algorithms like Dijkstra's, breadth-first search (BFS), or depth-first search (DFS) to find the shortest path between source and destination stations.
Fare Calculation: Calculates the fare based on the total distance between the source and destination stations.
Metro Route Display: Displays the shortest metro route between the two stations.
Heap Implementation: Implements a heap data structure, possibly for efficient sorting or priority queue operations.

Requirements
Any Java-compatible IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse, Netbeans, or online platforms like ideone.com.
Basic knowledge of Java programming.
Understanding of data structures (Graphs, Heaps) and algorithms (Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS) is beneficial.
Familiarity with the Java Collection framework is helpful but not mandatory.
